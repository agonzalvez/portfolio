# Portfolio

## Description

- I have created a possible portfolio site, which will house all future projects during my time in the bootcamp. 
- The navbar links will direct the user to the desire location in the page, with the exception of the "Resume" link, which will send the user to another page where my current resume will be housed.
- Each navbar links has its own hovering effect, with transitions and distinct colors, matching the overall color scheme of the site. 
- An about me section was added accordingly.
- In lieu of personal information,. I've added added a contact form to the bottom of the page, and when the user presses the button "Submit," it will open their default email, and will be able to email me directly.
