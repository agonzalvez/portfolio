# Portfolio

## Description
- I updated my portfolio to showcase some of the projects completed during my time in the bootcamp. The user will be able to read my bio, see my current projects, LinkedIn, Instagram, and my resume.

## Process
- I have redesigned my prior portfolio completely, using a grid layout.
- Used bootstrap for the header, navbar and jumbotron, and changed their styling to my liking. 
- The navbar links will direct the user to the desire location in the page, with the exception of the "Resume" link, which will send the user to another page where my current resume will be housed.
- Each navbar links has its own hovering effect.
- An about me section was added accordingly.
- Work section has been updated with current viable projects.
- Each work section has a hovering effects and sliding-like motion.
- I've added added a contact form to the bottom of the page.
